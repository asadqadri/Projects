# Car Brand Classification
A Car Brand Classification project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the Keras ResNet-50 model involves training a model to recognize and classify different car brands from images. ResNet-50 is a pre-trained CNN architecture known for its deep structure and effective feature extraction capabilities.

## Here's an overview of the key steps involved in such a project:

1. Data Collection:
Gather a dataset of images containing different car brands. Ensure that the dataset is diverse, representing various models, angles, and lighting conditions for each brand.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the images. Common preprocessing steps include resizing the images to a consistent size, normalizing pixel values, and potentially applying data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training set.

3. Labeling:
Label each image in the dataset with the corresponding car brand. This step is crucial for supervised learning.

4. Splitting the Dataset:
Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to fine-tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

5. Loading the ResNet-50 Model:
Import the ResNet-50 model with pre-trained weights. Keras provides pre-trained models that can be easily loaded for transfer learning.

6. Adjusting the Model for Classification:
Modify the top layers of the ResNet-50 model to suit the car brand classification task. Replace the final fully connected layers with a new set of layers that match the number of car brands you are classifying.

7. Freezing Layers (Optional):
Optionally, freeze some layers of the ResNet-50 model to prevent them from being updated during training. This is often done for the initial layers, especially if the dataset is small.

8. Adding Custom Layers:
Add additional custom layers to the model to fine-tune it for the specific task. This could include dense layers, dropout for regularization, and a softmax layer for classification.

9. Training:
Train the modified model using the training dataset. During training, the model adjusts its weights based on the features learned from the car brand images.

10. Validation:
Validate the model using the validation dataset to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

11. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve the model's performance on the validation set. This may include adjusting the learning rate, batch size, and other parameters.

12. Testing:
Evaluate the final model on the testing dataset to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

13. Deployment:
Deploy the trained model for car brand classification. This could involve integrating the model into a software system that can process images and provide predictions.

14. Monitoring and Maintenance:
Regularly monitor the model's performance, especially if new car models are introduced. Update the model as needed to adapt to changes.

This project allows you to create a model capable of automatically identifying the brand of a car in images, which can be useful in various applications, such as image recognition in automotive industries or car-related services.
